uBAD
----

uBAD is a library for creating behaviour trees in Unity3D.

It is aimed at programmers who are comfortable working with
syntax in a text file. However it does include a visual tool
to assist debugging and visualising a running behaviour tree.

and the Example/Example scene to see it's use in a BADReactor
component.
